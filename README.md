Smile Detection Selfie Project
-
This Python project leverages basic AI and ML techniques to create a smile detection selfie assistant, using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers. Users can automatically capture selfies when they smile.

Features
-
•	Face Detection: Utilizes Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect faces in real-time.

•	Smile Detection: Recognizes smiles within the detected faces and triggers a selfie capture.

•	Automatic Selfie Capture: Saves a photo when a smile is detected.

Installation
-
•	Clone the Git repository:

•	Install the required dependencies:

•	Ensure the Haar Cascade XML files are in the project directory:

-haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

-haarcascade_frontalcatface.xml

-haarcascade_smile.xml

•	Copy the “camera_click.wav” file to the project file directory.

Usage
-
•	Ensure your webcam (internal or external) is connected and facing you.

•	Ensure there are no obstacles concealing your face.

•	Run the script: 
 python smile_detection_selfie.py

•	The program will automatically capture a selfie when it detects a smile.

Contributing
-
Contributions are welcome! I'll be working on adding more features, such as improving detection accuracy and enhancing the user interface.
